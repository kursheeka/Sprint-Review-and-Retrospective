# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret and implemrnt user needs into a program by writing user stories and sprint planning. Creating user stories help because it makes sure that the team stays focus on the project at hand and prioritzing certain features based on what the user is asking for.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs by understanding what is being asked, coming up with a plan to implement, and designing the project. As I design I break the project into smaller parts so it is more manageable. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member is to be someone who can listn, communicate, and reliable. Someone who can work well with others, able to adapt quickly to differenct situations, and have strong resolution skills.
